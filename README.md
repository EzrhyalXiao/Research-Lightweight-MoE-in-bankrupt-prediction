# Nash Equilibrium of First Price Auction with Different Pariticipation cost

This paper studies equilibria of first-price auctions in independent private value
environments with different participation costs. Two types of equilibria are
identified: monotonic equilibria in which a bidder with a lower participation
cost results in a lower cutoff for submitting a bid, and nonmonotonic equilibria
in which a lower participation cost results in a higher cutoff. We show that
there always exists a monotonic equilibrium, and further, that the monotonic
equilibrium is unique for either concave distribution functions or strictly convex distribution functions with nonincreasing reverse hazard rates. There exist
nonmonotonic equilibria when the distribution functions are strictly convex and
the difference of the participation costs is sufficiently small. We also provide
comparative static analysis and study the limiting properties of equilibria when
the difference in biddersâ€™ participation costs approaches zero.
