# Nash Equilibrium of First Price Auction with Different Pariticipation cost

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Monotonic and Nonmonotonic Equilibria**:
  - **Monotonic Equilibria**: 📉 Where a bidder with a lower participation cost submits a lower bid.
  - **Nonmonotonic Equilibria**: 📈 Where a lower participation cost leads to a higher bid cutoff.

- **Existence and Uniqueness**: 💡 It is proven that a monotonic equilibrium always exists. Furthermore, this equilibrium is unique under either concave distribution functions or strictly convex distribution functions with nonincreasing reverse hazard rates.

- **Conditions for Nonmonotonic Equilibria**: 📊 Nonmonotonic equilibria exist when distribution functions are strictly convex and the difference in participation costs is sufficiently small.

- **Comparative Static Analysis**: 📊 The paper provides a comparative static analysis and explores the limiting properties of equilibria as the difference in bidders' participation costs approaches zero.
